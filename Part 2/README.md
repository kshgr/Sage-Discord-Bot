## Installation

If you are using Repl.it, all packages imported are installed automatically.

Else if you are making the bot locally -
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install discord.py.

```bash
pip install discord.py
```

## Usage
In [.env](.env)
```python
TOKEN={ENTER YOUR TOKEN}
```
* Send a message starting with 'hello' and the bot will respond with Hello There!
* When a message is deleted the bot tells what the message was and who was the author.
